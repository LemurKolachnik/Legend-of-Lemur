## Stone Kingdom
---

## Description
The Stone Kingdom is the oldest kingdom to have existed in the Overworld to date. Being partially secluded in the forest behind it, the kingdom held a lot of mystery, as many people didn't know of its existence. Made entirely out of stone, the intricate craftmanship that remained after all those years shows how devoted their people were to creating this place.
## History
The Stone Kingdom dates back to around the 1940s, and was the only kingdom in the Overworld to have been ruled primarily by a king, named King Magnus. It is speculated that the kingdom's population resided in the hundreds, which was significant for an undiscovered kingdom. It seemed that the kingdom had experienced some sort of fatal plague over the years however, as numerous gravesites have been found, dating to years 1951 to 1954. The Surge of 2001 had wiped out the remaining civilians, including King Magnus himself, and in 2017, was cleared out by Scarlet, Skylar, Nico and Jayden. Scarlet had been elected as the new ruler of Stone Kingdom by her peers and ruled ever since. The kingdom is mainly used as an arsenal for the Lapis Union however.
