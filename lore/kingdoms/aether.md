## Aether Kingdom
---
## Description
The Aether 'Kingdom', while not truly considered a kingdom is an ancient portion of inhabited land in the lower heavens, named The Aether. The buildings there appear to be made of quartz and marble that have been blessed by Gods themselves.

## History
The Aether 'Kingdom' is an ancient Kingdom built by the Gods, Aether and Apollo. They constructed this sub-heaven as a place for spirits to arrive at, and devotees to the Aether culture to live amongst them. The dimension itself was created for those souls who didn't quite make the cut to becoming one of The Divine (the angel faction of Heaven), but also weren't wicked enough to go to the Nether or Hell. There is no true ruler in this inhabited part of the realm, aside from its creators, Aether and Apollo. The people and spirits that live there live freely, without being subject to royal command.
