## History
The Lapis Kingdom had been erected in the summer of 1964 by Queen Azurine Galaxy and King Lucius Galaxy. They had two children in their lifetime, the eldest named Jasmine and the youngest, Lazuli. Azurine and Lucius' reign had been jeopardized by Jasmine in 1984, when she was only 20. She devised a plan to assassinate her parents to claim the throne as her own. When her motives were discovered, she had disappeared without a trace. and no one to this day knows what happened to her. Upon the passing of Azurine, Lucius had passed the crown down to Lazuli Galaxy and her husband Arthur in 1992.

Lazuli and Arthur had a child named Lillian in 2002, who was far too weak to live on her own. Due to their devotion to the Aether, they had brought Lillian to the Aether and received a blessing from Aether and Apollo - the soul gem of Achelois. Achelois' soul had been fused with Lillian's, which prolonged her life and gave her some of the Moon Goddess' abilities through use of the scepter. 

In 2012, Lazuli and Arthur Galaxy left Lillian in charge of the kingdom temporarily, while they went on a date outside of the kingdom's walls. They had been killed by Herobrine during the night of their date, and had not returned to the Lapis Kingdom, leaving Princess Lillian Galaxy as the current ruler.

After Lillian's marriage to Lemur Kolachnik in 2019, she had become Queen of the Lapis Kingdom officially and still rules today.
