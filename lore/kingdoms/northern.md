## Northern Kingdom
---
## Description
The Northern Kingdom is the largest kingdom known in the Overworld and is located north-northwest of the supercontinent. It is the other kingdom constructed out of ice, and remained a secret to the rest of the world until mentioned in Nautilius' final prophecy. It's population is surprisingly low for a large kingdom, as only travellers and dogsledders have discovered it, and became civilians later on.

## History
The Northern Kingdom had began its construction in late 2001, by Alex Kolachnik and her child, Gladius. Gladius helped with the construction as he got older and discovered his ability to become an ice demon (For≈°i) at will. After this discovery, it made the construction much easier, and by July of 2008, the kingdom had been completed. No ruler had officially been chosen at this time, but was presumed to be Alex, as the mother of the only other person there. Alex enslaved the minds of visitors who couldn't accept Gladius' gift, using her power of the Three Fates, and did so until 2014. In 2014, Alex and Gladius had a falling out, and Alex nearly used her Three Fates ability on her own son, before Gladius conjured a reflective piece of ice. Alex caught herself in her own gaze, and became enslaved to her own magic. Gladius abused this and made Alex his servant. Since then, Gladius ruled the Northern Kingdom.
