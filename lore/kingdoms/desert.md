## Desert Kingdom
---
## Description
The Desert Kingdom is the second largest kingdom in the Overworld and is located northeast of the supercontinent. It is mainly constructed from sandstone and terracotta.

## History
The Desert Kingdom was built in the 1950s by some travellers who got lost in the desert. It finished construction in 1955, and was decided to be ruled by the Sahara bloodline. Merneith Sahara was first to rule. Her reign over the Desert Kingdom lasted from 1955 to 1970. She had two children, named Oasis and Auryn Sahara. After Merneith's passing in 1970, Auryn had claimed the throne. The reign of Auryn lasted 37 years. Her position for the throne had been threatened by her younger sister Oasis in 1983. Her sister had gone mad as a result of some illness, and attempted to kill Queen Auryn Sahara. She was locked away to rot since then. In 2007, the throne had been stolen by Savannah Nile, who was wanted for witchcraft and sorcery. She used her powers of vocifery to preserve her life, by killing the queen and controlling the kingdom by force. Her rule lasted until 2020, when she was vaporized by Lemur, the Protector of Peace. Since then, the throne had been returned to the Sahara's, and Auryn's great-niece (Oasis' granddaughter), Cleo Sahara, was crowned as the new ruler.
