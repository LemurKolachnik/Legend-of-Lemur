## Nether Kingdom
---
## Description
The Nether Kingdom, residing in the Nether, was a massive kingdom which tamed most of the realm. Unlike many kingdoms, where the crown is passed down through the royal bloodline, this kingdom's crown was passed down to whoever kills the current ruler, as they are seen as the strongest person that will lead their kingdom to greatness.

## History
The Nether Kingdom is an ancient kingdom, dating back before years were counted. The Kingdom was constructed by Hades, Erebus and Thanatos, and had been ruled by them until they retreated to Hell (when the year count began). King Wither had been conjured by the three Gods and set to rule the Nether Kingdom. King Wither's rule lasted for 2017 years, until Lemur had killed him during a battle with Herobrine. Since then, the kingdom is ruled by Lemur, however, a figurehead named King KaÄ«ta resides in the throne room.
