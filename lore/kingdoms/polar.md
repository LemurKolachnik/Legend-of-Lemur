## History
The Polar Kingdom had first risen in 2012, by Lucinda Snowblossom, an ex-civilian of the Lapis Kingdom and Demigod to Khione, the Goddess of Ice. She had left the Lapis Kingdom at this time due to the amount of dislike she received, which she deemed as unhealthy for her and her safety. She used her powers of ice to conjure a cold spot in the centre of the supercontinent and built the Polar Kingdom from scratch with her companion, Vitaur, the polar bear. She has ruled ever since.
