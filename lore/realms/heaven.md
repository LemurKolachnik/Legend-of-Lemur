## Heaven

## Description
Heaven is the highest realm of the seven realms in the universe. They don't partake in much war, and the realm itself is really only inhabited by the other Gods, Goddesses and angels that call themselves 'The Divine'. Heaven is described as an area of light. There seems to be no distinguishing features such as buildings or monuments. Just a wispy floor that seemingly goes on forever. No matter where you are in Heaven, you are surrounded by nothing except white light. It is suspected that only those of a higher power (such as The Divine and the Deities) can witness what Heaven truly is.
