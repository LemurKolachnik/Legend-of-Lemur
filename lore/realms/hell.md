## Hell
---

## Description
Hell is the lowest realm of the six realms of the universe. Ruled by the Gods Hades, Thanatos and Erebus, the only other lifeforms here are demons and spectres. The realm consists of several continents, and of the continents, various demon races govern sections of it. Hell itself is experiencing an eternal civil war amongst the six demon races (Kaīta, Forši, Ēna, Gaiss, Gemes and Mirdzošs), with each race trying to claim other race's land. This ultimately led to the extinction of the Ēna race, but despite that, the races still fight to this day.
