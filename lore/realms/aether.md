## Aether

## Description
The Aether is the second highest realm of the seven realms in the universe. Created by Aether and Apollo, this realm was made to house the living and the dead in harmony. Spirits that didn't become part of The Divine ended up in the Aether, and can choose to live their lives there, or leave to the astral plane. The realm has a large kingdom-like civilization, but also holds untouched land, such as forests of golden trees, and ruins that stemmed from the birth of this realm. Several strange creatures can be found in the Aether such as Aerwhales (flying whales). The Aether had been involved in a war between itself and the Nether Kingdom, as their quartz resources originate from the Nether. Acquiring the resource meant trespassing into the Nether and stealing it. This war was resolved by Lemur once he was ruler, which involved an allowance for Aether forces to acquire their quartz in return for fresh food for the civilians to enjoy and cultivate.
