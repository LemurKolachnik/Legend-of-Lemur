## Nether

## Description
The Nether is the second lowest realm of the six realms of the universe. Described as a barren wasteland, the souls of the wicked deviate when exposed to this environment, becoming ghouls to outsiders, and forgetting their past life, and living a new one. While the realm is attempting to cultivate some life within, it has a far way to go before it can flourish into something beautiful. The Nether has biomes such as crimson and warped forests, basalt delta lands, and the sulfur plains. While outsiders can visit this realm with a portal, many wouldn't dare witness the horrors beyond the portal. The Nether was believed to be created by Hades, Erebus and Thanatos, however, the Nether itself is simply upper Hell.
