## End
---

## Description
The End is the fourth highest realm of the six realms in the universe. This mysterious realm existed since the beginning of time and space, and was fought to be created before even the Overworld. It is sometimes referred to as the "Realm of Origin," with the only land being floating islands in space. Within the central End, there lies a mysterious kingdom, comprised of enderpeople. Somewhere along the line, the air in The End became toxic to outsiders, resulting in disease to those who visited there. Aside from the central island, there are farlands that facilitate strange ecosystems, such as chorus forests, zaffre forests, gelatite forests and cergarite islands. The wildlife there had adapted to the dimension's form, as most animals can float or fly.
