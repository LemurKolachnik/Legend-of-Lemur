# Epilogue: Nothing is as it Seems
---

**(3 months earlier... during Herobrine's defeat)**

"Did you see that?" said a guard.

"Did you feel it?" said another guard, "It was so calming. Like a wave of serene grace."

"Yes, I felt it, I saw it too," said a regal figure as she walked out of the throne room menacingly. The two guards knelt and bowed before her and said formally, "My Queen. Grace us with your thoughts please."

The Queen peered over her balcony, and eyed the sandy horizon beyond her kingdom of sand, and scowled. She waved her fingers and the two guards' eyes turned bright blue. The Queen turned to them and said, "Firstly, you need to work on your speaking. I am your Queen, not some random person you'd find in these streets. Now address me properly!"

The two guards bowed again, but in a rigid, controlled manner and said, "Our sincerest apologies Queen Nile, of the Desert Kingdom. We have disgraced you, and we should be punished for such disgrace."

Queen Nile smiled slightly and said, "That's much better."

The two guards sighed a great sigh of relief, and the Queen waved her fingers, before saying, "Fight each other. To the death. Show your devotion to me."

The two guards then instantly flashed from cowardice, and calmness to brutal violence and anger, as they began to clash swords, in such a way that each swing of their arms caused joints to dislodge and crunch. Queen Nile laughed a sinister, but regal laugh as she watched the two guards 'dance' for her, to their graves... destroying each other with their swords, and themselves with their brutal force, which was too much for their bodies to handle. By the time it was over, both guards had perished, with dismembered limbs from the slicing, and pulverized bones from the impact, and just the sheer strength they used to kill each other.

"Awww... they both died." Queen Nile said.

"Queen Nile of the Desert Kingdom," said a herald as he entered the throne room and bowed much like the two guards did, but without bright blue eyes, "May I be graced by your presence? I have some rather disturbing news."

The Queen looked at the two bodies and muttered, "That... is how it's done, didn't even need me to do it for him."

Then Queen Nile turned to the herald and said, "Yes, Herald Silver, you may. Please do inform me of this odd phenomenon."

Herald Silver stood up in a formal way, with his back as straight and stiff as a board and said, "It appears as though the blue lights we've seen are from an unknown location, far from our domain, and somewhere in the East. We suspect that it-"

"Is not natural," Queen Nile stated calmly, "Apologies, I read on ahead."

The Queen looked back at the horizon, where the blue light had originated from, and squinted. Afterwards, she said, "I can't hear their minds. They're too far away. It's silent. But I agree. With the rumblings we felt and heard, followed by the lights, and lightning... It proves that it isn't a force of nature... but a force of humanity. Strong humanity."

The herald bowed once more and said, "Please grace us. What are your orders on the matter?"

*So it isn't just some random groups of people,* Queen Nile thought, *there are some strong forces over there... perhaps even a kingdom.*

Queen Nile waved her fingers, and the entire kingdom spoke in unison.

"Listen up Desert Kingdom, prepare yourselves for war. Not a single soul will defy me. Even if you are wounded, you will fight. You will defend your Queen at all costs, even if that cost is your life! Now cheer!"

The entire kingdom boomed with cheers and excitement in their glowing blue eyes, and the Queen smiled. She looked at the two bodies which have decomposed into nothing more than just sand and their clothing. Queen Nile then gestured her hand in a fluent motion, and the sand floated from the ground and went to float above her hand. She twiddled her fingers and in no time at all, the sand in her grasp formed into a minimap of the land they've discovered, and looked intently at a canopy shape on the map.

"We'll start there," Queen Nile said, "We've lost many people in that forest in unexplained ways. I never heard their mind again, which suggests to me they've been killed by something."

The Queen smiled and spoke softly, "Soon. Soon we will find out the secret of the Mysterious Forest. We are not alone. There are more people... and I won't stop at nothing, until everything is mine and under my control."

The Queen clenched her fist on the minimap and opened her fist to reveal a thorny rose, made of sand.

"We won't stop... even if the entire world must be buried under sand."
