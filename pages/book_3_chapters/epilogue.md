# Epilogue: The Prophet
---

**(Year 2018, in Lemur's hometown)**

Nautilius, the Portal Mage rummaged through his old papers, looking as frantically as he can for a blank sheet. He groaned in agony as he threw notes he had written in the past aside. *I must write it down,* Nautilius thought to himself, *I have to do it before... before it's too late.* Nautilius clenched his chest tightly, and wailed in pain as he finally found it. An empty sheet of paper. He whipped his arm across his desk, flinging papers and books aside, and reached for the nearest quill. He fumbled the quill in his hand, causing ink to spill across the paper, and he growled in frustration.

Nautilius flipped the page over and began to scribble in a crazed frenzy. He depicted several colourful images upon the page... images of death and war. He wrote numerous jumbled words where applicable, that came to him in his vision, but he didn't understand. *I must warn them of this... this threat... my final prophecy.* The prophecy within Nautilius' dying mind danced like fire, as he scurried his quill across the paper. He was about to finish writing when suddenly, he collapsed, and dropped the feather in his hand. *No... please... I'm not... fin...*

Nautilius drew his final breath as he passed away on the wooden floor of his home, buried in all his years of notes and knowledge.
