# Chapter 17: The Walls Fall Down
---

## Told by: Lemur


It had been a week since we've arrived at Lapis Kingdom. We've met many people and seen many things. Today I had a brief discussion with Steven, Bart and Dave, on why they exactly left my father's village. They're a mysterious bunch, being a multi-species trio and all and their motives for leaving was just that.

Many people didn't like the idea of befriending the common enemy like zombies or endermen, so they left for freedom of the hate speech.

Anyhow, aside from meeting the people of Lapis Kingdom, we've grown accustomed to the culture of the kingdom, almost leaving behind any worry of the outside world.

Thorn, Derek and I attended some of the knight training sessions that the kingdom held for those who wanted to become a knight. The style of the fight was much different from dad's fighting style, but it was a great experience. Unfortunately, we didn't qualify as knights due to losing a couple of points. You see, only one could become knight if they ace the examination.

Along with the training, I secretly visited the Osbournes frequently, to uncover more secrets that are held within me. So far, the facts we found are:

*1. Lemur's blood reaches an estimated 1673 K (equivalent to roughly 1400° C, or 2552° F), which, on average is hotter than magma.*

*2. Lemur's blood only reaches this temperature when he feels pain or some negative emotion such as anxiety, anger, agitation, or annoyance.*

*3. The blood doesn't exist for long wherever it lands. It is to be determined if it just evaporates, or if it becomes the flame itself (a semi plasma form).*

*4. The heat or flames caused by the blood doesn't have any effect on Lemur. He can stand in the flames and in fact, they would heal him, not wound him.*

*It is still unknown as to why the blood does this.*

The facts pleases me to know for safety reasons and perhaps could even be used in a strategic way. For example, if I doused an enemy in my blood while agitated, I could easily burn them alive. Kind of morbid, but in the face of do or die, that is a resolve I'm willing to take to live another day.

"Lemur, what are you thinking?" Thorn asked suddenly, disturbing my train of thought.

"I'm just reminiscing," I replied.

"Don't forget, Galaxy wanted to see you sometime today," Thorn said, "I swear she's got feelings for you."

Thorn then laughed a mighty laugh. I blushed at the thought of Galaxy and I being a couple, but I brushed off Thorn's comment as a joke.

I left to go to the castle, and to my surprise, Galaxy was waiting for me at the entrance.

"What took you so long?" Galaxy asked.

"I was just getting cleaned up," I said.

I did actually clean up, but that wasn't nearly what took me so long, but rather just daydreaming.

"Oh," Galaxy replied, "Well anyhow, I wanted you to come here because I had something to tell you."

"And what would that be?" I asked curiously.

Galaxy appeared to be turning slightly red in the face, and she said, "You still got that medallion?"

"Yes."

Galaxy paced back and forth before saying, "I gave that medallion to you for more than just to show my trust to you."

"Oh?"

"I also gave it to you because I lo--"

*BANG!*

Suddenly a large explosion appeared at the front gates, followed by several shrieks and screams of terrorized citizens.

"Oh no!" Galaxy exclaimed, "It can't be!"

"What can't be!?" I asked in slight terror.

Galaxy then ran towards the sight of the explosion and then more explosions happened.

*BANG! BANG!*

"Galaxy!!! Wait up!" I yelled as I chased her through the suddenly busy streets of scared people and chaos. I looked towards the explosion site and caught a glimpse of what appeared to be a lightning bolt, but instead of coming from the sky, it came from the ground, and it was followed by another loud explosion.

And that's when the nightmares and fears of the outside world reminded me that it will never be forgotten. Everything that everyone hid from inside this kingdom will now awaken them back into this living hell...

The walls came crashing down.
