# Chapter 6: The Princess
---

## Told by: Lemur

I woke up on the cold ground of a dark prison cell. I looked around to see if there was an exit, when all of a sudden, "Don't even bother, I've already looked. This place is built stronger than bedrock."
Then, a young woman came out of the shadows. She was blonde with light blue eyes. She had a shirt on that matched her eyes, along with white pants and a glittery cape. She took a couple steps towards me and reached for my hand. "My name's Lillian Galaxy, but please, just call me G... Or Galaxy. What's yours?"

I shook her hand and said, "I'm Lemur, where are we?"
She shrugged her shoulders and said, "I don't know, that creepy thing brought us here."
Then it hit me. "Where's my stick!?"
Galaxy laughed at that remark, until she realized I was being serious and said, "The creepy thing took our weapons and hid them in here... So if your stick was a weapon, then it would be where my scepter is."
"Wait, a scepter?" I replied.
"Oh, I forgot to mention, I am the princess of Lapis Kingdom."
That surprised me. I didn't know that royalty existed in this corrupted world.
"We have to get out of here."
I grabbed onto two of the metal bars on the door of the cell and tried to bent them apart. "They won't budge!" I said.
Galaxy then laughed and said, "Did you actually think that you were strong enough to do bend those bars!"
That really bothered me, so I replied, "Well at least I'm trying to escape!"
Galaxy looked at me with a surprised look on her face. *Oh no, I forgot that she's a princess.*
"Wow, you talked back to me... That takes guts, maybe you aren't as bad as I thought."
Galaxy then jokingly punched me in the shoulder. I winced of course, because she had a powerful punch. "Holy! You really need to become stronger, or else you'll never survive! I swear you are just skin and bone and no muscle... No offense." Galaxy said.
I looked around again and saw on the wall across from our cell, a device. *That must be the controls for the cell doors! If I can just hit the button, but I'm here, and the device is way over there... I'll need to hit it with a projectile.*
I patted myself down and couldn't find a single thing that I can throw at the button.
"What are you doing?" Galaxy asked.
"I need something to throw at that button. It could be our ticket out of here. " I replied.

Then all of a sudden... "Guards! Breach at the main doors! Take care of it!" boomed a speaker.
Moments later, guards started running by our cell and towards the main entrance. *That must be Thorn and Derek. They're here to rescue me.* Galaxy tapped my shoulder and when I turned around, I jumped when she was holding the skull that belonged to a skeleton. "Use this... This was from a prisoner here, who passed away and decomposed in this cell. They couldn't take him out, because I could've escaped, so they left him in here."
I thought that was disgusting, then I wondered just how long was she in here for? Despite the grossness, I grabbed the skull and aimed at the button. Then the voice came back louder, saying, "You'll mess up, don't mess up."
I was getting angry at this voice, so I launched the skull at the button, and I threw it with such a force, that the skull shattered and it's bone shrapnel went all over. Then, the doors to the prison cell opened. "Come on, I think I have a clue to where the weapons are." Galaxy whispered. So I followed her lead, down the dark corridors of the mysterious lair of Titanitro.
