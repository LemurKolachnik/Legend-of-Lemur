# Prologue: The Dreaded Curse
---

## Told by: Nautilius, The Elder Villager
Let me tell you a story of a terrible event that happened some 16 years ago. Now before I start let me tell you exactly when this started, back in year 2000, a year before the event.

**(Year 2000 : Somewhere in the Overworld)**


We appeared in a beam of light, reaping from the sky and ripping apart the leafy green ground that Overworlders called "Earth." I believed that Earth was a weird name to call a place that was tingling with the serene beauty that life and nature had to offer.

"Is this Earth? This can't be right, Nautilius, this place is too lively to be Earth." said Steve, one of the twin brothers of the Aether. Steve and his brother Brine were high-ranked knights of the Aether, and sent by Apollo and Aether, two of many Gods that chipped in to create a heaven for mortals, and rule it in the form of a council of Gods and Goddesses. They ordered Steve and Brine, to be teleported by I, Nautilius, the portal mage, to a place that Aether's people call 'The Overworld,' to create a base camp there to intercept any possible raids from either the Nethers or the Demonspawners factions. So there we were, on the Overworld. I furrowed my brow and stroked my beard. Steve's question really intrigued me. Is this really Earth?

"It is Earth, Steve, I never get my magic wrong, that's what the first hundred years of my life was. Mistakes, so don't you make some." Steve shrugged his shoulders and Brine as well. "This shall be where we make our beginning, this... is where our future begins."

**(December 3rd, Year 2001: The Day of The Tragic Event)**


It's been roughly a year when we were given a daring task by Aether. "What!? Why do we have to go to the Nether!?" Steve said. My face was emotionless although my heart was beating so heavily, I felt like I was going to collapse. I managed to release some words. "Because the Aether needs more Raw Quartz for more buildings for families to live in. Also, it is our duty to do as the Gods say!"

"It'll be alright Steve, don't forget our gifts." Brine reassured him. Even I forgot the gifts from Aether and Apollo. Apollo gave Steve a diamond sword that can summon spirit swords that fight alongside him and Aether gave Brine an iron pickaxe that can rip the earth apart and make spear heads that can fly in the air so fast that it breaks the sound barrier. So we built the dreaded Nether portal, as even my magic couldn't get them without a frame to bring us there. I lit the portal and how it crackled and glowed with this eerie purple light. "We'll be back before you know it." Steve said. And they jumped into the portal.

We entered the portal. Beyond the portal was nothing like what we ever imagined. The Nether was a barren wasteland, full of many evil beasts that didn't like visitors, as I take account to the many heads of fallen Aether knights, mounted on spears made of gold and iron. I found a head amongst them all, who I knew was my old friend Blaine, whose face was as full of fear and anxiety as mine held. My brother forced me to look away and continued onward. The Nether fortress was dark and morbid. Each corner we turned, we found more of our missing comrades, but in the form of mangled messes displayed as trophies in cases. We finally made it to the Quartz mine. It was full of magma and skeletons that were chained to the walls of the mine. "Ok, I'll start mining the quartz, and you cover me." Brine said to me. I nodded and took my defensive position. We managed to get enough quartz to stop mining and we packed up our stuff and left the mine. All the corridors looked the same, which caused some difficulty to find our way back, and that is when we were attacked. Blazes came at us and wither skeletons surrounded us in all directions. We were trapped. We attempted to defeat them all, but it wasn't before long that zombie pigmen had got us at their mercy. They took us to the throne room. It wasn't anything like the throne room the Aether had. This one had vats of lava and blaze rod chandeliers. In the throne, sat the leader of the Nethers, King Wither. King Wither was a tall, dark entity. He seemed part skeleton, part human... as if he were a corpse that stopped decomposing midway. Some say he can determine ones fate. No one dares to look him in the eyes because it was said he could take souls that way, by shattering the windows of it.

"Well, well, well. If it isn't some damn Aether knights!" the King snarled and growled, "State your damn business here!"

Brine was first to speak. "Well, we came to get some quartz."

"You mean steal our damn quartz!!!"

"You stole our damn comrades!" I blurted out.

"HOW DARE YOU TALK TO THE KING LIKE THAT! YOU SHALL BE PUNISHED!!!"

My brother jumped in front of me and spread his arms widely apart. "Take me instead!"

My heart dropped. "I mined the quartz, and I'm the one guilty of this, take me!"

The skeleton knights were mumbling to each other in some warped language and that didn't really ease the fear inside me.

"SILENCE!" the King said. The skeletons went silent almost instantly.

"Very well. I have made a decision. I will take the miner!"

"Why must you always be the hero Brine!"

"THAT! That is a wonderful name. You shall be known as Herobrine young lad!"

The King struck a morbid, magical skull onto Brine's back and burned the flesh off his back. Although it seemed it only effected him physically, it also effected him mentally. Brine screamed and shouted, cussing in between breaths, and King Wither was starting to turn him. Brine's last words were: "Run Steve!"

And so I did. I broke free of the guards and caught a glimpse of what Brine became. His eyes were lifeless, and glowed a ghostly white. The skull burn on his back was excruciating to look at. And his pickaxe was wrapped in lightning. I dashed through the corridors and tried to hold back my tears. Of all my years, would I ever think my brother would die. Then I jumped through the portal leaving my brother and happiness behind.

After some five hours, Steve returned... alone. "Where's Brine?" I asked. His face showed the answer as the mentioning of his name brought tears to his eyes. "Oh, I apologize."

"It's ok, just grab his stuff, let his wife know the news and we shall give him a ceremonial send off." So I obeyed Steve and went to Brine's house to break the news to Alex. Thump, thump thump!

"Alex, I have to tell you something, and its not good news"

No answer, so I knocked on the door again. Thump, thump, thump! Still nothing. So I opened the door and no one was inside, or at least, thats what it seemed. In a box on the bed, was a baby... a small baby. It had brown hair with a strand of blonde. I lifted up the child and I instantly knew that this child was Brine and Alex's child. I rushed out the door with the child to find Steve and when he did, he had mixed emotions. "Wh-What's that?" Steve asked.
"It's a child. I found him in Brine's house. Alex isn't home though," I said. Steve shrugged his shoulders and his expression showed confusion.
"Well, what am I supposed to do with it?" Steve asked.

"Well you could start by naming him, rather than calling him 'it'."

Steve noticed what he was saying and blurted out one word.
"Lemur," he said, "Let's name him Lemur."
