# Prologue: The Dreaded Curse

## Told by: Nautilius, The Elder Villager
Let me tell you a story of a terrible event that happened some 16 years ago. Now before I start let me tell you exactly when this started, back in year 2000, a year before the event.
**(Year 2000 : Somewhere in the Overworld)**

We appeared in a beam of light, reaping from the sky and ripping apart the leafy green ground that Overworlders called "Earth." I believed that Earth was a weird name to call a place that was tingling with the serene beauty that life and nature had to offer.

"Is this Earth? This can't be right, Nautilius, this place is too lively to be Earth." said Steve, one of the twin brothers of the Aether. Steve and his brother Brine were high-ranked knights of the Aether, and sent by Apollo and Aether, two of many Gods that chipped in to create a heaven for mortals, and rule it in the form of a council of Gods and Goddesses. They ordered Steve and Brine, to be teleported by I, Nautilius, the portal mage, to a place that Aether's people call 'The Overworld,' to create a base camp there to intercept any possible raids from either the Nethers or the Demonspawners factions. So there we were, on the Overworld. I furrowed my brow and stroked my beard. Steve's question really intrigued me. Is this really Earth?

"It is Earth, Steve, I never get my magic wrong, that's what the first hundred years of my life was. Mistakes, so don't you make some." Steve shrugged his shoulders and Brine as well. "This shall be where we make our beginning, this... is where our future begins."

**(December 3rd, Year 2001: The Day of The Tragic Event)**
It's been roughly a year when we were given a daring task by Aether. "What!? Why do we have to go to the Nether!?" Steve said. My face was emotionless although my heart was beating so heavily, I felt like I was going to collapse. I managed to release some words. "Because the Aether needs more Raw Quartz for more buildings for families to live in. Also, it is our duty to do as the Gods say!"

"It'll be alright Steve, don't forget our gifts." Brine reassured him. Even I forgot the gifts from Aether and Apollo. Apollo gave Steve a diamond sword that can summon spirit swords that fight alongside him and Aether gave Brine an iron pickaxe that can rip the earth apart and make spear heads that can fly in the air so fast that it breaks the sound barrier. So we built the dreaded Nether portal, as even my magic couldn't get them without a frame to bring us there. I lit the portal and how it crackled and glowed with this eerie purple light. "We'll be back before you know it." Steve said. And they jumped into the portal.
