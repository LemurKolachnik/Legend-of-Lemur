# Epilogue: The Wandering Spirit
---

Ever since the beginning of The Surge, several people have claimed to have heard some man cry out to their son, and some have even seen partial apparitions of this man. This ghost had wandered for eighteen years, longing to find his son, and for eighteen years, reports of the ghost have been made.

Since we lived in a world where spirits do exist, this wasn't too extraordinary... but what was, was the fact that this spirit hung on for so long. Normally, regular spirits move on almost as instantly as their physical body died... with exceptions to guardian spirits such as Yin and Yang... but this spirit insisted on sticking around... fading from existence unwillingly, but slowly.

One fateful day, in 2019, he had finally found his way to make it back into this world... when he wandered through the walls of the Lapis Kingdom. He found himself inside a mysterious room filled with old mechanical junk and yet, he kept wandering... until suddenly, he had fallen, due to his weakening state, and landed on a robot lying on the ground. To his surprise, his eyes opened within the robot and his voice was finally heard.

"Lemur!" the spiritsaid through the robot, "Lemur, where's my son!?"
