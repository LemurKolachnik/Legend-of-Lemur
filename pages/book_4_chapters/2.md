# Chapter 2: Mission Response

**(The next day...)**

"Evacuate! This is not a drill! Remain calm everyone, you hear me!? I SAID REMAIN CALM!!!" shouted a panicked civilian of a village. 

In a moderately large village, far northwest of the supercontinent in the Overworld, mass hysteria developed. Within the village, a rift between the Overworld and Hell had unexpectedly opened, and out spilled feral creatures of Hell, along with a few stray demons, aiming to claim the village as their new territory.
