# The Legend of Lemur Discord
---

> The Legend of Lemur Discord server was a server that ran from September 8th, 2018 to July 25th, 2022. It had a good run, but never really saw the activity it could've had. Therefore, the server had been shut down. This may **not** be the end of the Discord however, and it may return in the future... but for now, it is gone.
